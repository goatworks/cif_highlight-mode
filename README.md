# .cif highlighting mode #

This tiny file (cif.lang) is a GtkSourceView language definition file.
When added to the proper folder, allows a nice highlighting of .cif files 
in order to make them much more readable.
Works for gedit and all gtk based text-editors.
#### What are .cif files ####
.cif (Crystallographic Information File) files are extensively used in crystallography 
and structure definition sciences (chemistry and physics disciplines).


## Usage ##
Just place this file in the '~/.local/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs' folder 
(create the directory if it doesn't yet exist) and restart gedit in order for it to 
notice the addition.
